Step 1: Create a Repo
This involves logging into GitHub and creating the repo. You can choose to either initialize a README or not. 
It doesn't really matter because we're just going to override everything in this remote repository anyways.

Step 2: Initialize Git in the project folder
From your terminal and assuming Git is already installed on your computer, run the following commands after navigating to folder you would like to add:
  1. git init
  2. git add -a 
  3. git commit -m 'Added my project'
  4. git remote add origin git@github.com:scotch-io/my-new-project.git
  5. git push -u -f origin master
  
With this, there are a few things to note. The -f flag stands for force. 
This will automatically overwrite everything in the remote directory. 
We're only using it here to overwrite the README that GitHub automatically initialized. 
If you skipped that, the -f flag isn't really necessary.

The -u flag sets the remote origin as the default. This lets you later easily just do 
git push and git pull without having to specifying an origin since we always want GitHub in this case.
